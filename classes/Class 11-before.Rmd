# Review regression, minimizing mean squared error, finding line of best fit

```{r}
d = read_csv("../pset2/english.csv")
d$RT = d$RTlexdec
```

# Exercise: Which is better at predicting RT? Familiarity or WrittenFrequency?

```{r}
ggplot(d, aes(x=WrittenFrequency, y=RT)) + geom_point()

summary(lm(data=d, RT ~ Familiarity))
summary(lm(data=d, RT ~ WrittenFrequency))

l.written = lm(data=d, RT ~ WrittenFrequency)
d$resid = residuals(l.written)

ggplot(d, aes(x=WrittenFrequency, resid)) + geom_point()
```

# What about centering the variable? 

```{r}
```

# Reviewing logarithms

# Why use logarithms

# Exercise: compare predictions using exp(d$WrittenFrequency) and d$WrittenFrequency
