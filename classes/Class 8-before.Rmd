# Review from Class 7

Review mean, standard deviation, normal distributions.

```{r}
```


# Exercise 2


```{r}
d = read_csv("../textbook/data/perry_winter_2017_iconicity.csv")
arrange(d, -Iconicity)
```


Get the iconicity scores from d above. Rank them, look at them.

Now make a histogram. Find the mean and standard deviation. 

Now sample a normal distribution with that mean and standard deviation. 
How similar are they?

```{r}
```

# Mean as a model

Task: for a random word, predict the iconicity.

How wrong will we be!?

How wrong will we be (squared)?

Now do it for POS == "Interjection" vs. POS == "Name"

How wrong are we?
