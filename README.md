### Summary

Doing linguistics, or any kind of science, requires thinking about data. In this course, you will get a hands-on introduction to thinking about linguistic data. We will start with some basics of experimental design and analysis, move on to making visualizations and interpreting data, then cover topics in statistics like correlation and linear regression. We will be using the statistical programming language R, which is a widely used tool common to statisticians, linguists, computer scientists and professionals in fields from finance to ecology, from baseball to sociology. Knowing how to use R and interpret data is a hotly coveted skill in the modern world, so your experience in this class will be valuable beyond the (virtual) walls of LING 104. While we do not assume any programming background, you should be prepared to spend some time learning how to work with R. Just like learning any language of which you are not a native speaker, it takes time and practice to get fluent in statistics. You will have lots of help along the way!

Everyone can succeed in this class (even if you do not have experience in these topics or consider them to be "not your thing"), if you put in the work and effort! 

### Learning outcomes:

1) **You will be able to get data, analyze it in R, and say interesting things about it.** Knowing how to analyze data is a valuable skill. Imagine that someone runs up to you and says: "Help, I need to know what is going on in this data." By the time you leave this course, you will know how to take that data, make some graphs of it, and draw some statistical conclusions.

2) **You will learn how to come up with an experimental hypothesis and collect data to test that hypothesis.** To that end, in each class, we will spend time discussing and demonstrating methods. In the class projects, you will learn to design experiments and deploy these methods.

3) **You will come to appreciate the role of data and experimentation in linguistics.** Some fields of linguistics are seemingly far from the kind of quantitative work we do in this class. But, by drawing on examples from a diverse set of linguistics experiments, we will see that, no matter what sub-field of linguistics you are interested in, thinking about data is crucial.


### Projects
The class will be built around 4 short projects, in which you will get practice using R and doing data analysis.
 
### Readings
Our textbook is Bodo Winter's Statistics for Linguistics.

### Exit tickets
We will use Nectir for discussions and for class exit tickets, which will be accessible from our GauchoSpace. These count as part of your participation grade. You can also use it to ask questions, and we will respond as fast as we can. This is the preferred way for asking questions on homework so that we can all benefit! You can join Ling104 on Nectir or access it through GauchoSpace.

### R practices
On weeks when there are no big projects due, there will be little R practice assignments due. These are intended to take about an hour to complete and will keep you fresh in your R skills. You can skip one over the course of the quarter (complete 3 out of 4).

### A word about your well-being
We get it. The last year has been extraodinarily difficult and has taken a toll on all of us. We recognize there will be issues that come up throughout the quarter and that we can't expect "business as usual." We will make every effort to be accommodating to your needs, and we hope you will do the same for us instructors!

### Grading

| Activity|Weight|
|---|---|
| 4 projects (your best project will be worth 30%, your worst one will be worth 10%, and the other 2 will be worth 20%) | 80% | 
| 5 mini-R practices (mostly from textbook) | 10% |
| Class participation (participation in sections, polls, office hours)| 10% |

Late policy: 10% off each day late, down to 50% off. Then you can hand it in later for 50% credit. 50% credit is better than nothing! (I recognize these are extraordinary times, so please reach out ahead of time and we can potentially avoid late penalties.)
 

## Student Support Services  
  
(1) Disabled Students Program: accommodations for exams   
Students with disabilities may request academic accommodations for exams online through the UCSB Disabled Students Program at [http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/](http://dsp.sa.ucsb.edu/). Please make your requests for exam accommodations through the online system as early in the quarter as possible to ensure proper arrangement.   
  
(2) Managing stress / Supporting Distressed Students  
Personal concerns such as stress, anxiety, relationships, depression, cultural differences, can interfere with the ability of students to succeed and thrive. For helpful resources, please contact UCSB Counseling & Psychological Services (CAPS) at 805-893-4411 or visit [http://counseling.sa.ucsb.edu/](http://counseling.sa.ucsb.edu/) .   
If you encounter a student in distress, please contact 805-893-3030 immediately and/or consult the Responding to Distressed Student Protocol at [http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/distressedstudentsguide](http://www.sa.ucsb.edu/distressedstudentsguide) or phone 893-3030.  
  
(3) Building academic skills  
For general academic support, students are encouraged to visit Campus Learning Assistance Services (CLAS) early and often. CLAS offers instructional groups, drop-in tutoring, writing and ESL services, skills workshops and one-on-one consultations. CLAS is located on the third floor of the Student Resource Building, or visit [http://clas.sa.ucsb.edu](http://clas.sa.ucsb.edu).
							  
(4) Responsible scholarship  
Honesty and integrity in all academic work is essential for a valuable educational experience.  The Office of Judicial Affairs has policies, tips, and resources for proper citation use, recognizing actions considered to be cheating or other forms of academic theft, and studentsâ€™ responsibilities, available on their website at: [http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu](http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu).  Students are responsible for educating themselves on the policies and to abide by them.  
  
(5) Responding to Hate Incidents  
Hateful actions based on race, ethnicity, religion, gender, sexual orientation, gender identity, citizenship status, age, disability, or other aspect's of someone's identity and background are not acceptable. In the event that a hate crime or incident does occur, please report it. Reports may be made anonymously. [http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu/hate.aspx](http://judicialaffairs.sa.ucsb.edu/hate.aspx)
